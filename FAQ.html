	<strong>What is Chennai Trail Marathon?</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;Trail Marathon&rsquo;s within city limits are unknown experience in our city&rsquo;s history. Chennai Trekking Club (CTC) conducted the first trail marathon in October 2012, which was a history by itself since it was Chennai&rsquo;s first ever &lsquo;Trail Marathon&rsquo; unique from running on Tar roads in concrete jungle.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;We introduce to you trails along scenic routes in the outskirt of Chennai city to enjoy Running in natural atmosphere.</div>
<div>

	<strong>&nbsp;Who is CTC? What is the level of Professionalism you can expect in this Marathon?</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; CTC is a volunteer driven largest outdoor club in South India that almost treks in every weekend of the year. Rain or Shine it easy to spot our members camping in some forest of South India. We believe &lsquo;there is pleasure in the pathless woods&rsquo;</div>
