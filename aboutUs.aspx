                            The Chennai Trekking Club (CTC), is a non-profit volunteer based group of nature and trekking enthusiasts which organizes outdoor events during nearly all weekends of the year. Founded in 2008, the group has become one of the largest and most active outdoor communities in South India, encompassing 20.000 members and growing with 500 new members each month.Outdoor activities including easy 1-day, moderate and difficult multi-day treks, cycling, biking, outings, photography, workshops, ladies, kids & family treks, social initiatives, environment & conservation drives, swimming, marathons and triathlons. Experienced in map reading and navigation we have taken thousands of trekkers to many unexplored locations and discovered breath taking waterfalls, beautiful gorges, ancient forts and jeep trails hidden deep inside the jungles. Members should be aware of the inherent dangers of trekking in the wild and agree to behave in a responsible and safe manner. Disclaimer: participants take full responsibility and will not hold CTC and its organizers responsible for any incidents.

                            CTC's close touch with nature has triggered a love for our environment and organization of regular conservation events including massive cleanup and tree plantation efforts. The group also frequently engages in social activities taking out less privileged kids on 1-day outings to bring them a once in a lifetime experience. CTC organizes free presentations and workshops in the community on various topics related to map reading and navigation, photography, snakes, butterflies, first aid and survival and others. Yearly the group cleans up the entire Chennai coastal line over 15km with thousands of volunteers. Yearly CTC organizes a major trekking symposium Trek Polamaa to spread awareness on nature, outdoors, adventure, photography, wildlife and conservation, inviting several eminent guest speakers to talk about their life passion. The group also organizes periodic kids, senior and ladies treks.
